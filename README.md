## Tennis Refactoring Kata

### Description

**Original Kata**: https://github.com/emilybache/Tennis-Refactoring-Kata


This Kata actually consists of three sub-katas: `TennisGame1`, `TennisGame2` and `TennisGame3`.

Each one is a different implementation of the problem, but the behaviour is the same.

I have refactored `TennisGame1` and started working on `TennisGame2`, but may not finish now.

Maybe I'll come back to it in the future.
